# PrefGAN
GAN for producing preferences for Computational Social Choice.


2021 note:
This was used for my Undergraduate Honors Thesis at New College of Florida. Code was not public then and I cannot ensure this version is correct, but it may be useful for someone.

The code for my paper "Comparing Goodness of Fit of Preference Models" is also stored here.
